# Battle-Chess
Console Chess Game in Java

This Java-based program is a text console rendition of a modified Chess game, where users can play by inputting moves in standard algebraic notation.

Getting Started
  To start playing the game, simply compile the Main.java file using a Java compiler (version 8 or above) and run the compiled Main.class file.

Prerequisites
  You need to have a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 8 or above installed on your machine to run this application.

Features
  - The game includes all the standard chess pieces: King, Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight, and Pawn.
  - Moves inputted in standard algebraic notation (e.g., e4, Nf3, etc.).

How to Play
  - Compile the Main.java file and run the Main.class file.
  - The game begins with the chessboard displayed in the console and pieces in their initial positions.
  - Enter your move in standard algebraic notation when prompted.
  - When a piece is moved into a space of an opposing piece an RPG style fight insues where users input a number 1, 2, or 3 based on the move they want to use
  - Play continues until a King is defeated, which ends the game.
